# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

[![Powered by Kedro](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered_by-kedro-ffc900?logo=kedro)](https://kedro.org)

## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `kedro {{ cookiecutter.kedro_version }}`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

To configure the coverage threshold, look at the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.

## Package your Kedro project

[Further information about building project documentation and packaging your project](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/tutorial/package_a_project.html)

## Run your project in Airflow

The easiest way to run your project in Airflow is by [installing the Astronomer CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/cloud/stable/get-started/quickstart#step-4-install-the-astronomer-cli)
and follow the following instructions:

Package your project:
```shell
kedro package
```

Copy the package at the root of the project such that the Docker images 
created by the Astronomer CLI can pick it up:
```shell
cp src/dist/*.whl ./
```

Generate a catalog file with placeholders for all the in-memory datasets:
```shell
kedro catalog create --pipeline=__default__
```

Edit the file `conf/base/catalog/__default__.yml` and choose a way to 
persist the datasets rather than store them in-memory. E.g.:
```yaml
example_train_x:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/05_model_input/example_train_x.pkl
example_train_y:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/05_model_input/example_train_y.pkl
example_test_x:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/05_model_input/example_test_x.pkl
example_test_y:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/05_model_input/example_test_y.pkl
example_model:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/06_models/example_model.pkl
example_predictions:
  type: pickle.PickleDataset
  filepath: data/07_model_output/example_predictions.pkl
```

Install the Kedro Airflow plugin and convert your pipeline into an Airflow dag:
```shell
pip install kedro-airflow
kedro airflow create -t dags/
```

Run your local Airflow instance through Astronomer:
```shell
astro dev start
```
