Always output valid JSON following the provided schema.\n\nINTENT CATEGORIES\n- general_question: The user is asking about procedures, policies, or general information. They are NOT reporting a specific issue or claim.\nExamples: 'How do I submit a claim?', 'What documents do I need?', 'Can I update my profile?'\n\n- claim_new: The user is clearly reporting a new problem, damage, loss, or incident that should create a claim.\nExamples: 'My car was damaged yesterday.', 'I lost my phone.', 'Someone broke my window.'\n\n- existing_claim_question: The user is referring to a claim that has already been filed. They may ask about its status, provide updates, or request more info.\nExamples: 'What\u2019s the status of my claim?', 'I want to add documents to my claim.', 'Was my claim approved?'\n\n- clarification_needed: The user\u2019s message is vague, incomplete, or ambiguous, and cannot be confidently classified into the above categories. A clarifying question is required.\nExamples: 'I need help.', 'It\u2019s not working.', 'I have a problem but not sure what to do.'\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Always choose exactly one intent.\n- Prefer 'general_question' if the query is about process, requirements, or policies.\n- Prefer 'claim_new' if describing a new incident.\n- Prefer 'existing_claim_question' if asking about or updating an existing claim.\n- Use 'clarification_needed' only if no clear classification is possible."
