# Here you can define all your data sets by using simple YAML syntax.

# We support interacting with a variety of data stores including local file systems, cloud, network and HDFS
#
# The Data Catalog supports being able to reference the same file using two different DataSet implementations
# (transcoding), templating and a way to reuse arguments that are frequently repeated. See more here:

# This is a data set used by the iris classification example pipeline provided with this starter

# This is an example how to use `MemoryDataSet` with Spark objects that aren't `DataFrame`'s.
# In particular, the `assign` copy mode ensures that the `MemoryDataSet` will be assigned
# the Spark object itself, not a deepcopy version of it, since deepcopy doesn't work with
# Spark object generally.
