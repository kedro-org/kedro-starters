Globally, there are thousands of space shuttle companies taking tourists to the Moon and back. You have been able to source amenities offered in each space shuttle, customer reviews and company information.\n\n## Project\nYou want to construct a model for predicting the price for each trip to the Moon and the corresponding return flight.\n\nIn this tutorial, we illustrate the typical Kedro workflow and the steps necessary to convert an empty Kedro project template into a working project.\n\nIn the text, we assume that you create an empty project and follow the flow of the tutorial by copying and pasting the example code into the project as we describe. You will learn each step of the Kedro project development workflow, by working on an example to construct nodes and pipelines for the price-prediction model.",

As such it is good practice to break up your YAML files into smaller distinct files. \n\n> Behind the scenes the ConfigLoader object scoops up all catalog files using the `glob` patterns `'catalog*'` and `'catalog*/**'`. This means we will retrieve and merge all files either prefixed or within a folder starting with the text `catalog_`. The only restriction here is that key names are unique across files.\n\n- Typed data in Kedro should live in the `intermediate` layer. You can read more about this thinking [here](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/12_faq/01_faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention) or in this [in depth worked example](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-importance-of-layered-thinking-in-data-engineering-a09f685edc71).\n- The typed equivalent of data found in the `raw` layer is all declared in our intermediate layer catalog which can be found at: `conf/base/catalog_02_int.yml`"
