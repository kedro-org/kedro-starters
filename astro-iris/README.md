# The `kedro-starter-pandas-iris` Kedro starter

## Introduction

The code in this repository demonstrates best practice when working with Kedro. It contains a Kedro starter template with some initial configuration and an example pipeline, and originates from the [Kedro Iris dataset example](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/02_get_started/05_example_project.html).


### An example machine learning pipeline using only native `Kedro`

This Kedro starter uses the simple and familiar [Iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris). It contains the code for an example machine learning pipeline that trains a random forest classifier to classify an iris. 

The pipeline includes two modular pipelines: one for data engineering and one for data science.

The data engineering pipeline includes:

* A node to split the transformed data into training dataset and testing dataset using a configurable ratio

The data science pipeline includes:

* A node to train a simple multi-class logistic regression model
* A node to make predictions using this pre-trained model on the testing dataset
* A node to report the accuracy of the predictions performed by the model
